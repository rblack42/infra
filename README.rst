This repository contains files I use to configure my development machines. As a
teacher, I normally use all three major platforms:

  * Windows (Windows 10 Home)
    * Dell XPS 15"

  * Mac (Catalina)
    * Macbook Pro (15" 2016)

  * Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
    * Macbook Air (11" 2008)


I also maintain a number of *Virtual Private Servers*. Currently, these all
reside on DigitalOcean_.

Machine configuration on all of these machines begins with a basic installation
on the operating system. All other configuration work is managed using
Ansible_.
